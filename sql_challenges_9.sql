USE publications; 
 
/*******************************************************************************
ALIAS (AS) for tables
*******************************************************************************/

/* 1. Select the table sales, assigning the alias "s" to it. 
   Select the column ord_num using the syntax "table_alias.column" */

SELECT s.ord_num FROM sales as s;

/*******************************************************************************
